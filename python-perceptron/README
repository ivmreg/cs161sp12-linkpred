This module contains some basic implementations of the perceptron and averaged
perceptron (an approximation to the voted perceptron).

The perceptron is one of the simplest discriminative classifiers out there: for
a given training example x, if the perceptron classification y' is the same as
the correct label y, do nothing; otherwise, adjust the weight vector for class y
as w += x and the weight vector for class y' as w -= x.

==== JON's INSTRUCTIONS ====

to run the perceptron:

python perceptron_test.py

which will print to the screen the results for several different flavors of perceptron,
as well as a file, prob_results, which prints the probability for each individual 
followback prediction (columns are real, guess, and probability)

the data the perceptron is run off is in data/

flow-train.txt and flow-test.txt

this currently all test data and needs to be replaced with G+ data
